# Data Cleaning and Data Exploration Project in SQL 
I have cleaned and done an exploratory analysis on a dataset comprising global company layoffs from 2020 to 2023. Utilizing SQL, I have cleaned and prepared the dataset ("Data Cleaning Query" file) so that it can be used for exploration and analysis ("Exploratory Data Analysis SQL Query" file) to uncover significant patterns and trends in layoffs across different industries and regions. 

This project demonstrates my ability to work with SQL for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, using various SQL functions like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries to showcase my skills and provide valuable insights into complex datasets and supporting data-driven decision-making.
